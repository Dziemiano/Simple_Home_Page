# Simple Home Page

Hi.

This is my first solo project after few weeks of learning JavaScript.

Main goal is to make a simple home page for everyone to use, featuring some weather info,
top news from user country, simple to do list, and some social features.

As the main core is now done i released it at dziemiano.github.io, but work is still in
progress because current code for sure isn't ideal, and i would like to add some new
features in future.

Hope you'll like it!
